# To Do

0. Fix `npm build` (do something about the tests in the audio meter I guess)
1. Make work in Safari (maybe by moving away from ScriptProcessorNode?)
2. Change font of the ticks in the meter
3. Add a "Start meters but don't unmute" type button
4. Typescript-ify cast.js
5. Import the mux stream tool
6. Some way to control the list of streams without needing a commit
7. Remove mute/volume control from <video> tags
8. Maybe allow starting the audio processing by clicking the room name button / even the whole video tag?
9. Clicking the <video> shouldn't pause the stream
10. Fix the now very broken horizontal mode.

# To Done

1. Handle window resizes
2. Show peak visually (not just text at top)
3. Finish Typescript-ifying dynamic.js
