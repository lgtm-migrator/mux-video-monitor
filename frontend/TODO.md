# To Do

1. Make work in Safari (maybe by moving away from ScriptProcessorNode?)
2. Change font
3. Add a "Start meters but don't unmute" type button
4. Finish Typescript-ifying dynamic.js
5. Typescript-ify cast.js
6. Import the mux stream tool
7. Some way to control the list of streams without needing a commit
8. Remove mute/volume control from <video> tags
9. Maybe allow starting the audio processing by clicking the room name button / even the whole video tag?
10. Clicking the <video> shouldn't pause the stream
11. Fix the now very broken horizontal mode.

# To Done

1. Handle window resizes
2. Show peak visually (not just text at top)
